            <p>Hi everyone, I am currently enrolled in the SE Flex program set to start on May 16th. My background is in cosmetology. I have been a hairdresser for 5 years in Seattle, WA. Although, I live about a hop, skip, and ferry ride away from Seattle. My mother brought my siblings and I from the Philippines back in 2001 and have lived in Bremerton since then. She kept our culture strong even though we lived in America, so naturally I am bilingual. I thank her every day for that. I can understand and speak Tagalog and English. Though sometimes my brain has a hard time juggling the two and I end up fumbling my words. I have an abundance of clients who are in the tech world who have graciously allowed me to pick their brains and it has been amazing. I was then turned to freecodecamp to see if I would like coding and it was so entriguing. How one thing does another and what you can create and see that you created it, its all just like a puzzle that makes a masterpiece. I have picked up gaming again, and have forgotten how much I enjoyed it. My dream would be to work for a company that is in the gaming area. In Seattle, we have Xbox at Microsoft and Nintendo. Oh, a girl could dream. I look forward to this experience and working with everyone. I've enjoyed how supportive everyone has been and feeling like I am not alone in this. It just makes it that much better.</p>
